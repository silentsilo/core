# Changelog

Notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The version follows
semver, and anything that could stop an existing silo from opening needs a
major version rather than a note.

This repository has its own version line, separate from the desktop
application's. A client pins a tag from here; the tag it pins is what its
release notes should say.

## [1.0.0] - Extracted from the desktop repository

The crates, formats, fixtures and extraction tool that shipped in SilentSilo
1.0.0 on 21 August 2026, moved here unchanged. No format, no behaviour and no
public API differs from what that release contains. The dependency graph was
compared before and after: same packages, same versions.

What moved: `silentsilo-core`, `silentsilo-crypto`, `silentsilo-vault`,
`silentsilo-vfs`, `silentsilo-sync`, `silentsilo-store`, `silentsilo-s3`,
`silentsilo-fido`, `silentsilo-extract`, `silentsilo-fixture`,
`silentsilo-testkit`, along with `FORMATS.md`, the cryptography
specification, the compatibility fixtures for the 1.0.0 format era, and the
CI jobs that exercise them.

What did not move: the Tauri application, its OS integration crate and the
frontend, which stay in
[silentsilo/desktop](https://github.com/silentsilo/desktop).
